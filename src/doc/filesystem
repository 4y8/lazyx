Layout of descriptor block (all measures are in bytes):

offset | size |                       description
-------+------+----------------------------------------------------------------
   0   |  1   | Always set to -1
   1   |  108 | File's name without the path (NUL-terminated string)
   109 |  8   | User's ID (in little endian)
   117 |  8   | Group's ID (in little endian)
   125 |  12  | File's size (in little endian)
   262 |  32  | User's name (NUL-terminated string)
   294 |  48  | Group's name (NUL-terminated string)
   342 |  166 | File's absolute path without the file's name (NUL-terminated 
       |      | string)
   508 |  4   | Relative address to the first data block of the file (See data
       |      | blocks)

Data blocks:
All data blocks start with a 4 bytes header containing the relative address of
the next data block. The last data block's address is set to 0. The unused 
bytes of the last data blocks are left uninitialized. All the addresses are
relative to the filesystem root (the file system root has address 0 even 
though it is not true in RAM).
